# Polymorphism

RULE #1. MASTER BRANCH THOU SHALT NOT BE COMMITED/MODIFIED/EDITED. Doing it could damage the project and YOU don't want that.


RULE #2. Your changes, your branch. Eventually some mod or me we'll compare and decide which things should change and which definetly not.


RULE #3. Any request, look @ Rule #1


Please, be nice and hope anything of this could help you.

With <3, Gabe
